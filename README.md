## Dependencies:

Python 3, YOLO Object Detection Algorithm, ImageJ

## Instructions for Deployment:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab.
1. Run the cells in the notebook upto the point where the code says it will begin analysis (will take around 10 minutes).
1. Give it the required Google Drive Access Permissions when prompted.
1. Choose the video you want to run analysis on, and save it as "input.mp4" into the MyDrive/darknetProject/darknet/data.
1. Now run all the remaining cells.
1. The output file will be generated and stored into the MyDrive/darknetProject/darknet/data folder.


## Usage Instructions:
The received CSV file will now contain all the required data points of the centre of the player whose positions are to be analysed. We can now infer any analysis we want using MatPlotLib.
We can create the density plots, as well as the point plots, and then combine all the point plots into the movement video using ImageJ.
